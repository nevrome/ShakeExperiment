# ShakeExperiment

A small experiment, where I use the [Shake build system](https://shakebuild.com) to define a simple, computational pipeline of R scripts.

This project accompanies the blog post [here](https://nevrome.medium.com/my-workflow-automation-journey-discovering-shake-haskell-5c270b93ff2b), where the script files are introduced in detail.
